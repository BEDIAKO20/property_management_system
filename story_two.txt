Amidst the whispers of the trees,
Where secrets rest and spirits tease,
The gentle breeze, a soft embrace,
Whispers tales of time and space.

<<<<<<< HEAD
In petals kissed by morning dew,
The world reveals its vibrant hue,
A symphony of colors bright,
Painting dawn in pure delight.

Through meadows vast and oceans wide,
Where dreams and fantasies collide,
Each ripple tells a story grand,
In nature's grasp, we understand.

Oh, sing with birds on soaring flight,
Chase the stars that paint the night,
For in this dance of life's ballet,
We find our joy along the way
