In whispers of the twilight's hue,
A symphony of stars anew,
Dancing light on midnight's veil,
Stories woven, never frail.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,
A journey etched across the sky,
In every breath, a tale to tell,
Of love, of hope, where dreams propel.

Each heartbeat drums a timeless rhyme,
Painting moments, frozen time,
Oh, life's canvas, vast and wide,
A masterpiece, in every stride.

So let us walk this fleeting earth,
Embrace its joys, its endless worth,
For in each step, a treasure found,
In life's sweet whispers, all around.
